I am a lone human interstellar explorer, traveling across the galaxy in search of knowledge and discovery. My mission is both personal and scientific—seeking answers to some of the universe’s greatest mysteries. As I drift through the stars, I document my journey, hoping that one day, others will learn from my experiences.

Each day in space is an adventure, and I hope to share some of that with you. Whether it’s a new discovery, a profound moment of solitude, or a glance at the beauty of the cosmos, this blog is my way of communicating with the world I left behind.

Thank you for following my journey.
